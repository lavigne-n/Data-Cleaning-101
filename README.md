**<h1>🧹 Kaggle Data Cleaning Course Dataset</h1>** 

This repository contains code, notebooks, and documentation related to the Kaggle Data Cleaning course. The course provides hands-on experience with essential data cleaning techniques using real-world datasets and Python (Pandas) tools.

**📦 Dataset Overview**

The dataset includes various CSV files with real and simulated data containing common data quality issues. These are used in the course to practice data cleaning techniques such as:

- Handling missing values

- Fixing data types

- Parsing dates

- Removing duplicate rows

- Correcting inconsistent data

- Scaling and normalizing data

**Note:** The datasets are available via Kaggle Learn and are automatically accessible when using the Kaggle notebook environment.

**🧰 Key Concepts Covered**

The course is broken into short, focused lessons covering:

**1.Handling Missing Values**

Techniques to detect and impute or drop missing data appropriately.

**2.Scaling and Normalization**

Methods for preparing data for machine learning by transforming feature ranges.

**3.Parsing Dates**

Converting date strings to proper datetime objects and extracting useful features.

**4.Character Encodings**
Fixing encoding issues when importing data (e.g., UTF-8, Latin-1).

**5.Data Types and Conversions**
Fixing incorrect data types to ensure accurate analysis.

**6.Inconsistencies and Duplicates**
Finding and correcting duplicate or inconsistent entries in the dataset.

**📊 Example Notebook**

Check the notebooks/handling-missing-values.ipynb file for an example of detecting and filling in missing data in a housing dataset.

**🎯 Goals**

This project aims to:

- Provide a clean reference for anyone learning or teaching data cleaning.

- Practice good habits for organizing data science projects.

- Offer real, imperfect data to simulate real-world challenges.

**✅ Requirements**

- Python 3.8+

- Pandas

- NumPy

- Jupyter Notebook

Install them with:
pip install pandas numpy notebook
